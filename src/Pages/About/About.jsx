Hey there! I'm Yacob Menghistu, a passionate storyteller who wears two hats: a visual storyteller through photography and videography and a digital architect through full-stack web development.
Photography/Videography:
Capturing moments has been my obsession since I first picked up a camera. I find beauty in the everyday and depth in the extraordinary. Whether it's landscapes, emotions, or events, my lens seeks stories waiting to be told.
Full-Stack Web Development:
Coding is my other canvas. I thrive on creating digital experiences that blend functionality and beauty. From designing seamless interfaces to building robust backend systems, I craft websites and applications that engage and inspire.

Bringing it Together:
The magic happens when I merge these passions. Whether it's creating stunning websites to showcase visual masterpieces or integrating immersive media for a captivating user journey, I thrive at the intersection of art and technology.
Explore my portfolio, where visuals and code collide to form captivating stories. Let's embark on a creative journey together!
